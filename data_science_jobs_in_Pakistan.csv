About MetaGravity
MetaGravity is a deep-technology startup headquartered in London which is solving the concurrency problem in distributed simulation to handle immense virtual worlds and games with dense player, AI and physics interactions. We are fully funded and have grown to over 60 employees over the last 12 months. Very rarely for a deep tech start-up we are earning significant revenues in our first year of operation.

Current game engines and game servers can handle a peak of ~100 players in a self-consistent “instance”. However, the next generation of online games and metaverse experiences demand much larger simulated realities beyond what is currently feasible — think, tens of thousands to millions of players and AI beings in a single instance. MetaGravity is solving this problem. We’re working from first principles to build distributed computing infrastructure that is limitless in its ability to scale, thus empowering creators to craft truly living, breathing worlds. We are also dog-fooding our tech by building our own mediaeval fantasy sandbox MMO game called Edge of Chaos, leveraging all of the potential of the MetaGravity infrastructure and blockchain platforms.
 MetaGravity was founded by experienced entrepreneurs and long-term collaborators Rashid Mansoor (Chief Executive Officer) and Tobin Ireland (Chief Business Officer). Our team is composed of seasoned entrepreneurs and innovators with decades-long experience in distributed systems, supercomputing, decentralised infrastructure, game engine development and AAA game production. We are deeply committed to our cause, believe in its immense upside potential and embrace bold, first-principles thinking in our approach to problem-solving.

About HyperScale Engine
The HyperScale Engine addresses the struggles faced in existing multiplayer environments, which often cap out at a mere 100 concurrent players, or stumble when confronted with scalability barriers below 1000 concurrent players. We see The HyperScale Engine as a solution to the surging demand for larger scale multiplayer games and real-time experiences. 

Unveiled at the Games Developer Conference in San Francisco, The HyperScale Engine was showcased alongside esteemed partners such as Star Atlas, Wilderworld, and Earth2. The demos revealed thousands of players seamlessly engaging in massive multiplayer experiences with uncompromising visual fidelity in single shard worlds. The physics-driven gameplay and intricate interactions illustrated the immersive complexity now possible.

Ideal candidates are those who are not only proficient in AI and software architecture but are also visionary in their approach to leveraging technology for business innovation.

In this role, you will lead our team in shaping the architectural frameworks and strategies that integrate AI into our software solutions. This role is integral to our mission, and your work will directly influence the productivity and quality of our deliverables. We invite you to join us if you are passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology and eager to make a tangible impact in the software industry.

What You Will Be Doing

Design the overarching architecture for AI-driven systems that automate complex aspects of software development, such as architecture generation, dependency management, and advanced predictive coding.
Deep dive into the latest developments in AI and software engineering by participating in R&D initiatives, attending conferences, and engaging with academic and professional communities. When a new AI technology comes out, we need to be among the first to know about it.

What You Won’t Be Doing

Routine Code Maintenance: Regular updating or debugging of existing software code to fix minor issues or improve functionality.

 Overview

In Pakistan, eye health services are an integral part of the government health system, led by the National Committee for Eye Health (NCEH). The NCEH, which includes government and civil society stakeholders such as Sightsavers, has developed the ambitious IPEC plan 2020-2030. This plan highlights the need for strategies targeting disadvantaged communities, including women, the elderly, and people with disabilities.

Validate initial findings through a workshop with implementing partners.
Provide recommendations for adjustments to the project and future similar projects.
Contribute evidence towards answering Sightsavers’ thematic learning questions for refractive error.
Coordinate with various stakeholders to ensure timely delivery of activities and high-quality outputs.

Extensive experience in monitoring and evaluation for international development projects/programmes, with strong skills in both qualitative and quantitative approaches.
Thematic expertise in eye health evaluations, preferably with experience in refractive error, inclusive health, and primary eye care.
Comprehensive understanding of preferred practices and policy issues at global and national levels.
Strong understanding of equitable access to inclusive healthcare for women, people with disabilities, and other marginalised groups.
Prior experience working in Pakistan, preferably within the project regions, including data collection experience.
Ability to travel within Pakistan, mainly within the project districts (Multan and Sheikhupura).
Proven ability to produce concise, readable, and analytical reports.
Excellent communication skills in written and spoken English. Fluency in local languages in Pakistan is highly desirable.
Proven ability to work independently, manage resources, and deliver work within agreed timeframes.

We anticipate the work will require approximately 30-45 person days’ input, depending on the methodology and approach proposed. The work should be conducted between August and December 2024.

Payment Terms
Consultants with a proven track record in the above will be procured to undertake the project through an expression of interest process. Payment terms will be agreed between the Consultant and Sightsavers. The budget ceiling for this work is around PKR 3,000,000 inclusive of all expenses.

About Us

Taptap Send is backed by top VCs (Spark, Canaan, Reid Hoffman, Breyer Capital, etc.), rapidly growing and a great place for those looking for both impact and a fast-paced tech startup environment. Read more about the journey in Reid Hoffman’s words or TechCrunch article

Launched in 2019, Taptap is tapping into a transformative shift in global finance: from banks to phones. While this has affected wealthier countries as well, it has been nothing short of a revolution for the emerging markets where the overwhelming majority of population had been unable to access digital finance previously. Taptap Send allows immigrants to send money home instantly and with no fee*, saving money in the process. With a formal market size of >700B alone, we’ve got a lot more saving to do for our users. Our mission is to reduce inequity by helping immigrants move money home, and become the leading cross-border fintech for emerging markets. And that’s just the beginning...

We charge fees for transfers on fixed exchange rate corridors (e.g., XOF, XAF).
